Supple
======

Supple is a flexible motion and interpolation library for JavaScript. It exposes its tweening and interpolation capabilities separately, so that it is customizable for a wide variety of applications.

Supple is designed to be:

- lightweight
- modular
- universal (2D/3D motion, interpolation of arbitrary values)
- extensible (interpolation plugin system)
